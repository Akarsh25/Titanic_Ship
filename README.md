# Titanic_Ship
Titanic Ship(OpenGL project)

The mini Project implemented here is a “Titanic Ship”. It is designed using OpenGL.
This mini project is a simulation of ship where the ship sinks as it hits the ice berg on its way.
One can view this mini project as a scene where ship, water, ice berg, stars and flash lighting
are designed. The mini project is developed in night mode where stars are visible. The water
implemented here shows the wave effects simulating a ocean view. The mini project is
developed by using different built-in and user- defined functions. By making use of different
effects and functions of OpenGL the ship, water, ice are viewed colorfully.
